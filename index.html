Our city, “Hydro Perth,” is designed to be modern and futuristic. Due to rising water levels, a place like this is necessary, as locations worldwide are threatened underwater. The city is located north of Perth, Australia. We chose this location because of its sound current, climate, and great weather. The population consists of a variety of people, around 40,000. We chose our area because the region has few tropical storms.
