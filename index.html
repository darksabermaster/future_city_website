Our city, “Hydro Perth” is designed to be modern and futuristic. If water levels were to rise, a place like this would necessary, as locations worldwide could be threatened by the water. The city is located north of Perth, Australia. We chose this location because of its sound current, climate, and great weather. The population consists of a variety of people, around 40,000. We chose our area because the region has few tropical storms.
